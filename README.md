# Udemy_course_projects

Contains multiple projects done while doing the Learn Python in 100 days with Angela Yu on Udemy.

Will definitely take more than a 100 days.

learning_exercise 1: A basic quiz game with a score counter. OOP is really weird to wrap your head around first time.

learning_exercise 2: A few basic run arounds with the turtle program using the basics of OOP

learning_exercise 3: Feed my gambling addiction with a basic turtle runner.

learning_exercise 4: My snake game. First time building something that works. Headache of a bug too. Fun.
